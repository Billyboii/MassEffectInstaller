# MassEffectInstaller
***Note this is untested on Mass Effect Legendary Edition***

Installs mods and DLC for the Mass Effect games
This application has been made possible by a lot of resources and code snippets that I have found and learned from online. It was made
mainly for fun and for convenience. It was always a hassel to reinstall all my mods and DLC everytime I replayed the Mass Effect
series, so I decided to automate it.


This program requires minimum the Windows 10 anniversary update with BASH functionality, Windows Powershell, and .NET Framework 4.0 or
higher to run. That being said if you do not have any of these, the program will walk you through installing each of them.


StackOverflow was an excellent resource for learning Batch and bash scripting from the online community.
nircmd.exe is used in the program to center the window and I understand any users concerns for not wanting to use it because of that.
This program is not malicious towards it's users in anyway. This is all made through Batch and bash scripts and you can check
through each line of code yourselves before running any of it.
